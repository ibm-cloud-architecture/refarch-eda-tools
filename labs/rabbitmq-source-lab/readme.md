# RabbitMQ source connector lab

This folder includes the necessary files to do the RabbitMQ source connector lab as [documented here](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-eda/use-cases/connect-rabbitmq/).

For OpenShift Deployment, you can follow the [RabbitMQ product documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/kubernetes/operator/install-operator.html) and use our manifests:

* []() defines the custom resource definition
* []() define the Security Context Constraint
* [cluster-operator.yaml](): Define the rabbitmq-system namespace
